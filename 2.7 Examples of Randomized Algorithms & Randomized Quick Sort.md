## Max cut problem
Let $G = (V, E)$ be an undireacted gragh. For $U \subseteq V$, let
$$
\delta (U) = \{ uv \in E: u \in U and\ v \notin U \ (or\ v \in V-U)\}.
$$
The set $\delta (U)$ is called the **cut** determined by $U$. The the max cut problem is to find:
$$
max \{ |\delta(U)|: U \subseteq V\}
$$

***Randomized Algorithm:*** Return a uniformly random subset of $V$. So every vertex are uniformly randomly assigned to either $U$ or $V - U$.

*Claim: The subset U  the algorithm returned is a 1/2 approximation, i.e. $E[\delta (U)] \geq OPT/2$.*

***
*Proof*: For every edge $uv \in E$, define a random indicator variable $X_{uv}$ to denote whether the edge is in the max cut set. Let $X_{uv} = 1$ if $uv \in \delta(U)$. Then
$$\begin{aligned}
E[\delta(U)] &= E[\sum_{uv \in E} X_{uv}]\\
&= \sum_{uv \in E} E[X_{uv}]\\
&= \sum_{uv \in E} Pr[X_{uv} = 1]\\
&= \frac{|E|}{2}\\
&\geq \frac{OPT}{2}
\end{aligned}$$

**A better guarantee:** our goal is to return a cut that is 1/3 optimal with high probability.
*Analysis:*
For k executions of the algorithm: let $C$ be the number of edges in $\delta(U)$, $Z = |E| - C$, then $E[Z] = |E| / 2$. According to the markov's inequality, we have:
$$\begin{aligned}
Pr[C \leq \frac {|E|}{3}] &= Pr[Z \geq \frac{2|E|}{3} ]\\
&\leq \frac{E[Z]}{\frac{2|E|}{3}}\\ 
&= \frac{3}{4}
\end{aligned}$$
This means after k executions, the probability of all the k results are less or equal to $|E|/3$ is no more than $(\frac{3}{4})^{k}$. So the probability of at least one result is greater or equal to $|E|/3$ is $1 - (\frac{3}{4})^{k}$. Therefore, we can conclude that the algorithm could return a $1/3$ approximation after k executions with high probability of $1 - (\frac{3}{4})^{k}$.

## Randomized Quick Sort

- Input: an array $A$ of $n$ distinct elements, left and right endpoints $l, r \in \{ 1,2,...,n\}$
- Output: elements of subarray $A[l], A[l+1],...,A[r]$ are sorted from smallest to largest

*Algorithm:*
1. if $l \geq r$ then return
2. $i := random\_pivot(A, l, r)$ // choose the pivot from $\{ l,...,r\}$ uniformly at random
3. swap $A[l]$ with $A[i]$ // put the pivot in the first position of the subarray
4. $j := partiton(A, l, r)$ // reorganize subarray using $A[l]$ as pivot
5. $quicksort(A, l, j-1)$
6. $quicksort(A, j+1, r)$

*Analysis:*
We will bound the expected number of comparisons in the call of $partition()$.
- Given the input array, denote by $z_i$ the ith smallest element.
- For every pair of indices in $\{ 1,2,...,n\}$ with $i < j$, define $X_{ij}$ as the random variable denoting the number of times the elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ get compared by Quicksort, i.e. $X_{ij} = 1$ if they do get compared and $0$ if it does not.
- Then, the total number of comparisons is:
$$
X = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j = i+1} ^{n} X_{ij}
$$
Therefore,
$$
E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j = i+1} ^{n} E[X_{ij}] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j = i+1} ^{n} Pr[X_{ij} = 1]
$$
- For general $i < j$, observe that $z_i$ and $z-j$ get compared **if and only if** one of them is chosen as pivot before any of $z_{i+1}, ..., z_{j-1}$, because if the pivot is chosen between them, then they would never get compared since they are in different subarrays. Hence,
$$
Pr[X_{ij} = 1] = \frac {2}{j-i+1}
$$
Then,
$$ \begin{aligned}
E[X] &= \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j = i+1} ^{n} E[X_{ij}] \\
&= \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j = i+1} ^{n} Pr[X_{ij} = 1] \\
&= \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j = i+1} ^{n} \frac {2}{j-i+1} \\
&= \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{k=2}^{n-i+1} \frac{2}{k} \\
&\leq 2\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (H_n - 1) \\
& \leq 2n(H_n - 1) \\
& \leq 2n \ln n
\end{aligned}$$
In conclusion, $E[X] = O(n \log n)$.
